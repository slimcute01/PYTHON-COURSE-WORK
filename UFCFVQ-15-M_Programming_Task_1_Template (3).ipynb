    "For this assessment, we were expected to create functions that solved the problems while only using python built-in functions, by creating our algorithms. This was aimed at helping us gain a deeper understanding of the task and the course altogether.  We were informed by our tutor that the questions might seem easy, but they could be tricky. The note of caution made me read both instructions and questions carefully irrespective of how simple they may seem initially, and this helped me through solving this assessment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, I felt I could round up the entire part of this task in a week or less because it seemed like basic python fundamentals, but as I progressed through the task, I realized the task was needing more effort to complete. I started to feel discouraged by the time I reached task5, I knew I had to put in more work if I wanted to complete this task. By the time I had completed the entire task, I was feeling more confident about my pure python programming skills.\n",
    "\n",
    "Creating functions was particularly interesting for me as this task helped me realize I could solve any problem if I was able to develop an algorithm for it. I learned to define multiple functions within the same solution and create functions that took in previously defined functions. My initial attempt at question 5 resulted in printing the column name and the column content, but a further evaluation of the question helped me realize that the result printed should have the column name as a string and the column content in a list, and this same concept needed to be applied a couple more times through the assessment.\n",
    "\n",
    "For questions one (1) to four (4), I first figured out the formula required and used it to derive a solution.  For example, where I needed to find an average, I had to first know how to calculate average, then break down this formula into simple steps my system could understand, so I would write a code that teaches my system how to also calculate this average.  In questions five (5) and six (6), I used with open function to read my CSV file and converted the list into a dictionary. Solving for questions (7) and (8), I created a dictionary that takes in all functions defined from questions 1 – 4 and used these functions to calculate the statistics of my data from task 6. Finally, I printed my result into a table format.\n",

    " In conclusion, I need to practice more if I want to be better at solving tasks like these efficiently. I learned that I became more conversant with codes the more I used them. \n",
